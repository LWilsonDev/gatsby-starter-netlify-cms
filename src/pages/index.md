This ranges from producing hit radio shows for BBC Radio, presenting live reports for ABC Radio (Australia), to performing across the globe, writing numerous arrangements, plus writing and starring in a 5* sell-out comedy show for the Edinburgh Fringe.

After studying classical music at The University of Nottingham, Patrick worked as an editor on the New Grove Dictionary of Music alongside production at Jazz FM, before moving to BBC Radio 3, working on Jazz and Contemporary Music programmes. Since 2007, he has been freelance, producing TV and Radio music programmes.

Patrick has also forged a successful freelance career as a professional musician, singing on adverts and choral CDs; and as a trombonist, performing and/or recording with acts as varied as ska legend Prince Buster, bluegrass band Hayseed Dixie, rockney giants Chas ’n’ Dave, various Jazz bands, and legends in lederhosen,[ Oompah Brass](www.oompahbrass.com), whom he also fronts at over 100 shows a year.

Patrick’s brass, orchestral and choral arrangements and compositions have been heard on BBC 1, ITV and Channel 4, as well as Radios 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and in venues such as Ronnie Scott’s, Bristol Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall. He writes choral arrangements for Sing Up! and his brass arrangements are soon to be published by [Superbrass Publishing.](http://www.superbrass.co.uk/)

His educational work includes classroom teaching, peripatetic teaching (lower brass, bass guitar), workshops and Outreach programmes, being a music expert for Ofqual, and being a guest speaker at music educational conferences. Patrick lives in London with his wife and three children, and enjoys watching Marx Brothers films, drinking leaf tea, and being unnecessarily pedantic about grammar.
